To test the system, we waved an object in front of the motion sensor to see if the
corresponding motor turned off.  We also waved an object in front of the IR distance sensor
to see if the corresponding motor turned off. At first the system did not work, so we made adjustments
in the code.  We initially used 8-bit PWM, but it did not work.  We used 10-bit fast PWM and it worked.
Since the bluetooth module can only send a byte at a time, we had to scale the 10-bit number received from
the ADC to an 8-bit number.  To do this, we divided the 10-bit number by 4.  When the Arduino that
controls the motors received a byte from the bluetooth communication, it multipied the data by 4 to
unscale the number.
