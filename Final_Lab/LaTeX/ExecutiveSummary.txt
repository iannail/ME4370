\section{Introduction}
In this final lab, the objective was to use two microcontrollers connected through Bluetooth to control two "fans". The fans are two motors that are speed controlled with potentiameters. Additionally, two sensors are used to turn the motors off at any moment given object detection. This system demonstrates the remote control of motors and the use of object detection using proximity and motions sensors for a safety systems. 

Several analog to digital conversions take place to operate this system. The potentiameters are analog inputs converted into a digital number between 0 and 250. Where 0 is the motor stopped and 250 is the motor at max speed. A total of two potentiameters, each controls one of the two motors.

The sensors are also analog inputs converted into a digital signals. Two sensors were used. The SHARP 2Y0A02F18 IR distance sensor and the HC-SR501 IR motion sensor. The distance sensor was used to turn off motor1 if it detected an object within 20 cm. The motion sensor was used to turn off motor2 if motion was detected in the sensors field of view.

Two HM-10 bluetooth modules were used to communicate data from system to system. The bluetooth modules were configured to pair with one another and with the serial UART TX and RX connection with the microcontroller.
