\section{Executive Summary}
In this lab, the objective is to use the Arduino Mega 2560 to develop a product that makes use of a stepper motor. The stepper motor is the driving mechanism for a pulley system. Two buttons control the direction of the stepper motor.  One of the buttons will make the pulley go up and the other will make the pulley go down.

Stepper motors are extremely useful in mechatronic systems.  Stepper motors are not useful for high speed systems, but good for simple low speed systems; at low speeds, stepper motors have high torque.  Stepper motors are useful due their very accurate open-loop control system, however, this comes at the expense of weight.  Stepper motors are very heavy since they have magnets with coils of wire in them.  An advantage of stepper motors is that, if one of the coils is powered, it takes a very large external force to rotate the shaft.  This is because the electromagnetic force will lock onto the shaft's magnet causing this locking effect.
