\section{Executive Summary}
In this lab, the objective is to use the Arduino Mega 2560 to develop a product that makes use of a stepper motor. The stepper motor is the driving mechanism for a pulley system. Two buttons control the direction of the stepper motor.  One of the buttons will make the pulley go up and the other will make the pulley go down.

Stepper motors are extremely useful in mechatronic systems.  Stepper motors are not useful for high speed systems, but good for simple low speed systems; at low speeds, stepper motors have high torque.  Stepper motors are useful due their very accurate open-loop control system, however, this comes at the expense of weight.  Stepper motors are very heavy since they have magnets with coils of wire in them.  An advantage of stepper motors is that, if one of the coils is powered, it takes a very large external force to rotate the shaft.  This is because the electromagnetic force will lock onto the shaft's magnet causing this locking effect.

We used the ULN2003 Stepper Motor Driver PCB to as the driver. The driver board accepts a four bit command from the microcontroller and in turn applies the necessary power pulse to step the motor. At the heart of the driver is a ULN2003AN integrated circuit. The board can supply between 5V to 12V to the motor from an independent power supply. It also has a bank of LEDâ€™s that correspond to the input signals received from the controller. They provide a nice visual when stepping.

The motor steps when a specific combination of inputs are driven from the microcontroller. This is just a pulse of power, just enough to get the motor to step. This driver uses a very simple protocol. Applying a signal to an input pin causes power to be sent to the motor on a corresponding wire.
