\section{Executive Summary}
In this lab, the objective is to use the Arduino Mega 2560 to read in analog values from an infrared distance sensor.  A program was
written to convert the analog values to the distance in centimeters.  To determine an equation that will successfully convert the raw
analog values to a distance, distance and analog value measurements were taken.  The data was plotted into Excel where a line of best fit
was determined.

The minimum objectives were:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Application must use Sharp GP IR ranger with analog output
\item Must demonstrated a resolution of .5 cm or better 
\item Must display measured distance in cm (best) or inches
\item Must have some output that makes use of the range sensor information 
\item Implement and demonstrate in a product application
\item Demo to lab assistant, instructor or other person with mechatronics background, document in your report.
\item Test your product on someone outside the class, record their use of your product, discuss outcomes in your report.
\end{enumerate}
